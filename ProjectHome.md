## Overview ##
CheckTree is a jQuery plugin, written for jQuery 1.2.6, that allows you to easily turn a standard ordered list into hierarchical tree that is both check-able and collapse-able.

It, like jQuery, is licensed under either the GPL or MIT license.

I saw a fork of CheckTree by ycTIN that looked to be much faster. I figured I'd give a shot to optimizing some of CheckTree, and have a first beta of 0.3 available. This version works fine with jQuery 1.3.2, and seems to be must faster than 0.2.
I tested the two on a tree with about 250 items and found 0.2 to take almost 2000ms, where 0.3 took only about 400ms.

I can't really say for sure whether it is fully backwards compatible and bug free, so use at your own risk. Bug reports would be greatly appreciated.
